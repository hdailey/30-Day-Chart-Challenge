Debris: large intact blocks of 4m tall and 2m wide (largest).  Avg. blocks of 1-2m tall.  ""Hard Slab"" type blocks.  Debris did not run far as evidenced by proximity to start zone and deposition mostly on road and just below.  Debris pile was ~100'-150' wide and 12'-20' deep.  Snowpack layers were still visible on intact blocks of debris, such as ice crusts and various rounded layers between.

Small gully/path (simlar size) that is looker's left of slide path:  5'-12' deep snow melted /pulled away from cliff band.  Seperated from rock wall by about 5'-15'.  

Snow has ""summerlike"" characteristics; dirty surface, small dimples, small amount of red algae.  Very ""mature"" snowpack. 

Thoughts: water running off rock wall lubricated the bottom of entire gully snowpack to the point that even the downslope portion of snowpack could not provide enough compressional tension to support the amount of snow in gully.  The gully is bounded by two ribs on each side that were devoid of snow.  No snow was left in gully (i.e. no crown line, flanks, or stauchwall)."

Appears to have been triggered by rime ice from the Garden Wall during warming on 5/4.  We were in the Granite Park vicinity on 5/4, but visibility prevented much viewing.  Lack of new snow on avalanche debris leads us to conclude that this slide occurred on 5/4 and photos indicate that rime ice fell from Garden Wall and triggered small WL that triggered this very large slab.  It appears to be a dry slab that entrained wet snow below 6500 feet.  Debris was very characteristic of wet avalanche debris.  Some debris piles exceeded 15 feet.  Bed sfc had the classic wet snow striations (lots of friction).  Avalanche occurrred on Greater Granite path on small ridge/spine and split.  Half of debris went down Greater Granite track to flats and other half went into Granite Park flats.  Avalanche destroyed small trees with diameter up to 6 inches.  Some dendro work, maybe???

Gould in Glacier National Park. The slope was a steep (>35 degree) slope and the avalanche initiated on a rocky part of a south-facing slope. The slope was well off of any ridge, but in a wind loaded pocket. The slide was small (20-30 ft. wide) and ranged in depth from 4 inches to 12 inches at the deepest point. 

Also, it was fairly easy to trigger loose sluffs (moist, but not quite wet) on most slopes steeper than 35 degrees. With the underlying melt-freeze crust serving as a good bed surface, these sluffs were able to entrain a decent amount of snow and travel fairly far downhill. They are certainly large enough to knock someone over or off your sled."
